  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>My name is Laura Gee. I am a senior majoring in Technical Writing and Communication. This is my first time making a website, and it has been quite a challenge. Currently I'm working as a student web editor for the College of Liberal Arts Office of Insititutional Advancement. I was orginally planning to analyze Protocol 46's website for this project, but now am considering switching to a CLA departments website that I am more familiar  </p>
